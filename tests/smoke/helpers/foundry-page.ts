/**
 * Foundry-specific Playwright helpers.
 *
 * Connects to a running Foundry world (launched separately by the developer
 * or CI), logs in as the configured user, and waits for `game.ready`. The
 * smoke specs then call `evalInWorld()` to run their probes inside the
 * browser context — the same scripts that ship in docs/test-runbook.md.
 *
 * Configuration via env:
 *   FOUNDRY_URL          (default http://localhost:30000)
 *   FOUNDRY_USER         (default "Gamemaster")
 *   FOUNDRY_GM_PASSWORD  (default "" — fresh smoke worlds have no GM password)
 *   FOUNDRY_SMOKE_WORLD  (default "od6s-smoke" — the world id this harness
 *                        is allowed to interact with; identity-guarded to
 *                        avoid trampling a developer's personal campaign on
 *                        the same Foundry instance)
 *
 * Note: `FOUNDRY_PASSWORD` is *not* read here — it's the foundryvtt.com
 * website password used by `task foundry:start` for license activation,
 * and is intentionally distinct from the per-user join password.
